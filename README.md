# C868 Software Development Capstone Project Final (JavaFX Application) (2 Parts)

Final Project for Western Governors University class "Software Development Capstone"

## Task (Part 1):

In this task, you will organize ideas for your capstone project so you can create your project more efficiently. In order to start your work on the capstone project, you must discuss your ideas for the project with a course instructor. After you reach an agreement on the topic, you must fill out the top portion of the attached “Software Development Capstone Topic Approval Form” and send it to the course instructor, who must digitally sign it and lock it to prevent further changes to the document. The completed form signed by the course instructor must be uploaded together with the other documents required for this task.

It is the policy of Western Governors University (WGU) that student capstone projects should not be based on or include any proprietary or classified information. Capstone projects should not contain any material belonging to your employer or any other organization without permission. Such material belongs to this third party and is referred to as “restricted information,” which requires you to obtain the party’s permission to include the work. You must declare whether or not your capstone project is based on and/or includes restricted information as you submit the attached “Capstone Waiver.” This completed attachment gives you permission to use restricted information from a third party. The “Capstone Waiver Forms” must be digitally signed by you.

Projects involving human subjects or the use of protected data will require IRB approval. Work directly with your Course Instructor if your project includes research that involves human subjects in order to determine whether it requires review by WGU’s Institutional Review Board (IRB).

## Requirements (Part 1):

#### A.   Complete the attached "Software Development Capstone Topic Approval Form." Include a signature and date from your course instructor to indicate that this form has been approved.

#### B.   Complete the attached "Capstone Waiver" after choosing the option that applies to your capstone project and digitally signing it where applicable.

#### C.   Acknowledge sources, using in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized.

#### D.   Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.

## Task (Part 2):

This task is the design, development, and implementation of the software application that was approved by a course mentor.

Your work for this task will not be evaluated until the appropriate forms from Task 1 have been submitted and evaluated.

## Requirements (Part 2):

#### A.   Write a comprehensive summary that addresses the following requirements:

-   the business problem or opportunity you are solving for, including a description of the customers and why this application will fulfill their needs

-   deliverables associated with the applied software development life cycle methodology

-   the plan for implementation of your software solution, including the anticipated outcomes from this development

-   the methods for validating and verifying that the developed software application meets the requirements and subsequently the needs of the customers

-   the programming environments and any related costs, as well as the human resources that are necessary to execute each task in the development of the software application

-   a projected timeline including milestones, start and end dates, duration for each milestone, dependencies, and resources assigned to each task

#### B.   Design and develop a fully functional software application that addresses your identified business problem or organizational need. Include each of the following attributes as they are the minimum required elements for the application:

-   one of the following application types: mobile, web, or stand-alone application

-   a database component with the functionality to securely add, modify, and delete the data

-   ability to generate reports with multiple columns, multiple rows, date-time stamp, and title

-   exception controls

-   validation functionality

-   industry appropriate security features

-   design elements that make the application scalable

-   a user-friendly, functional GUI

#### C.   Create each of the following forms of documentation for the application you have developed:

-   a design document including a class diagram and design diagram

-   a test plan for a unit test, including screenshots

-   the results of the unit test based on the provided test plan, including screenshots

-   source code and executable file

-   link to where web app is hosted with HTML code (if applicable)

-   user guide for setting up and running the application for maintenance purposes

-   user guide for running the application from a user perspective

#### D.   Acknowledge sources, using in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized.

#### E.   Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.

## Evaluator Comments:

"You clearly summarize a proposal to implement the WeSchedule application following the Agile methodology with clear details of the gaps the application addresses to provide a system to eliminate errors and missed notifications due to bugs in the system for the organization." "The existing gaps the solution addresses to eliminate errors and missed notifications due to bugs in the system is provided to support the development of the new solution."
