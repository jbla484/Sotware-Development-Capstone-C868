Software 2 Project - Java Application Development

The purpose of this application is to meet the business requirements stated by the software company I have
been contracted to. They want a working GUI scheduling application that meets their needs and performs well
in a business environment. It must be able to be read and maintained by other programmers.

This application was created by James Blankenship on April 4th, 2022. It's currently in it's first version
(Version 1.0), and the last update was on April 5th, 2022. Contact James via email at Jbla484@wgu.edu.

IDE Version: IntelliJ Community 2020.01
Java Version: Java SE 17.0.1
JavaFX Version: JavaFX-SDK-11.0.2
MySQL Driver Version: mysql-connector-java-8.0.25

You may run the program in an IDE of your choice once you have the specified Java and JavaFX version
installed on your computer. Open the IDE and either run the program from the main class in Main.java
or find the run button somewhere near the header of the IDE.

I added a report that shows how many scheduled hours each contact has. This will hopefully help them
plan better for their week/month. I also added total login attempts to the reports, which administrators
could use to monitor their employees accounts for security (Brute force password attacks).
